# PURPOSE

This pipeline was designed to run metabat2 on SUMMIT HPC

# HELP

1. Prerequisites:

   1.1. Using the conda environment on Summit. For the setup please see this link 
   		(https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software/python.html?highlight=anaconda)
   		After setup the conda environment, conda create/install metabat2 with the environment name "metabat2"
   		Change the paths in the run.pbs file with yours
   
   1.2. Need to run Trimming Pipeline & Assembly Pipeline
   
2. Pipeline execution:
   
   2.1. Simply execute `./RUNME.bash <dir>`, where `<dir>` is the folder containing
      the 04.trimmed_fasta folder (see help
      message running `./RUNME.bash` without arguments).

3. What to expect:

   By the end of the run, you should find the folder *15.metabat2*, including the following
   files for each dataset:
   
   3.1. `<dataset>`: The metabat2 output folder.
   
   3.2. `<dataset> for bowtie2 files`
